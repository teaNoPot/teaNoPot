### Hi there, I'm Abderrahim - aka [teaNoPot] ðŸ‘‹

## I'm a Writer, Developer and an AI enthusiast!
- ðŸ“« Iâ€™m currently working on an API that gives parents and guardians access to their kids' food schedule in school. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Spring Boot, Hibernate and other elements of Java.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with other developers.
- âœ¨ 2020 Goals: Join a fencing club, hone my skills as a developer.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love playing bowling and social games.
- ðŸ’¬ About my username: teaNoPot is a reference to my maghrebian culture. Whenever we have a family/friends meeting we bring a pot of tea and drink (the very same tea time in london but in a traditional sense). Now since I drink alot of tea, I barely have the time to get my pot next to me so I put everything in a mug, thus the name teaNoPot.. yeah stupid and has nothing to do with my culture, I just wanted to make a link alright? SUE ME.
